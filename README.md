This code defines if the input is numbers or letters. This code basically explains that if the input is not something within the variable DECIMAL_DIGITS then it is false but if it is within DECIMAL_DIGITS then it is true. In other words, if you input letters or any special characters then it will return false but if you input numbers then it will return true. During this assignment I learned how to program a computer into telling the difference between numbers and letters. This assignment also aided in helping me practice using for loop and helped me practice defining functions.
